Look back at the plan and know what is currently implemented. See what's still missing, what are the gaps? Are there any hacks, silent failures, things that look like they work but they don't work, or placeholders and such? And if there is, reflecting it, create the plan on how to fix it and to reach 100% alignment with the vision from the plan and implement that. We are not working on the web UI right now, so we don't need web UI and dashboard that's in the future. But the rest of it that we are currently implementing should work.
