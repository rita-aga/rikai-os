> The ambitious goal that guides all decisions.

## The Problem

You save things in different places. You interact with different apps. Every time you open a new app, there's no shared context. Your life is fragmented across tools that don't talk to each other.

You have a lot of data — messages, calendars, documents, code, conversations — but no coherent view of your own life.

**The data exists. The understanding doesn't.**

And when you need to share context with someone else — dump what's in your head into their head — there's no way to do it. You resort to long emails, repeated explanations, context that gets lost in translation.

## The Vision

RikaiOS is a **Personal Context Operating System**.

Three components:

**Umi (海)** — The Sea. Your context lake. Everything you've seen, done, saved, written — aggregated into one place. Structured data, vectors for semantic search, files. The memory layer.

**Tama (魂)** — The Soul. Your agent. Built on Letta. It reasons over Umi, organizes your context, surfaces insights, acts on your behalf. A proactive assistant that learns your patterns and represents you.

**Hiroba (広場)** — The Plaza. Federation layer. Permission-scoped rooms where your agent can share context with other people's agents. Collaboration without giving up ownership.

## The Agent

Tama is a proactive assistant that:

**Organizes** — Processes incoming context, creates structure, surfaces connections you missed.

**Suggests** — "You mentioned X last week and Y today — these seem related." "You have a meeting with Sarah tomorrow. Here's what you discussed last time." "Based on your patterns, you usually take a break now."

**Acts** — With your permission, takes actions. Books things. Sends messages. Manages tasks. "Your son usually does soccer on Tuesdays — should I book that for him?"

**Represents** — In federation scenarios, Tama can argue on your behalf. Two agents can negotiate, debate, reach resolution — then present the outcome to the humans for final decision.

It handles the busywork so you don't have to.

## Success Criteria

RikaiOS succeeds when:

1. **Unified context** — All your data in one queryable place
2. **Proactive assistance** — Agent surfaces insights without being asked
3. **Federation works** — Your agent collaborates with others' agents
4. **You own it** — Self-hostable, open source, your data stays yours
