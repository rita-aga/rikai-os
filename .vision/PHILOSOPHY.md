> Core beliefs and decision-making principles.

## The Name

**Rikai (理解)** — Understanding, comprehension. Easy for English speakers to pronounce.

The kanji 理 (ri) means logic/reason. "Understanding" as a whole captures the goal.

**Kioku (記憶)** — Memory — was considered. More accurate to storage, but felt passive. The agent understands and acts, not just remembers.

The Japanese naming signals the philosophy: simplicity, intentionality, naturalness.

## Design Principles

Japanese design principles guide RikaiOS:

- **Kanso (簡素)** — Simplicity. Clean separation of concerns.
- **Ma (間)** — Negative space. Don't build everything. Be intentional.
- **Shizen (自然)** — Naturalness. Work with existing tools (MCP, Letta), not against them.

The vibe is **stillness and clarity**. Marie Kondo for your digital life.

## Core Beliefs

### Ownership
You own your context. Not Google. Not OpenAI. Not Anthropic. You.

### Model Agnosticism
Switch providers without losing context. Claude, GPT, local models — your choice.

### Federation over Isolation
Your AI and my AI should be able to talk. Context shouldn't be copied manually.

### Privacy as Configuration
Self-host for full control. Cloud for convenience. Hybrid for balance. You decide.

### Open Source Core
The core is always open. Revenue comes from hosting and enterprise features, not lock-in.

## What We're NOT

- We're not trying to beat OpenAI/Google/Anthropic on features
- We're not building a walled garden
- We're not optimizing for engagement or data collection
- We're not making decisions for users without consent

## Decision Framework

When making product decisions, ask:

1. Does this increase user ownership of their data?
2. Does this work with existing tools (MCP, Letta, etc.) rather than replacing them?
3. Is this the simplest solution that could work?
4. Does this respect the user's privacy configuration?

If yes to all, proceed. If not, reconsider.
